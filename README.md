# Website-Pet-Project
This is one of my first small project that will be updated until I am satisfied with results I get.
At the moment there are two interactive pages. Most important one is "Home" page, where you can try your luck with "Gamble!" button. Chances of getting a good artifact is low and unfair (probabilities taken from game).
There will be artifact evaluation and save button that will allow you to store up to X artifacts. Probably I'll add a minigame of collecting full set and leaderboard later.
